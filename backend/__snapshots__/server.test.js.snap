    "description": "The <i>Text</i> is Book 1 of 4 (three books and one supplement) of the A Course in Miracles series. <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, also known as "the Course" or ACIM, was scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman. It is a self-study course that aims to assist listeners, readers, and students in achieving spiritual transformation. ACIM presents a purely non-dualistic philosophy of forgiveness and includes practical lessons and applications for the practice of forgiveness in one's daily life. <br /><br />As its title implies, <i>A Course in Miracles</i> is arranged throughout as a teaching device. It consists of three books: <i>Text, Workbook for Students,</i> and <i>Manual for Teachers.</i> The order in which students choose to use the books, and the ways in which they study them, depends on their particular needs and preferences. Two supplements to the Course: "Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice" and "The Song of Prayer", are also included as part of ACIM. <br /><br />The curriculum the Course presents is carefully conceived and is explained, step by step, at both the theoretical and practical levels. It emphasizes application rather than theory, and experience rather than theology. Although Christian in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum. There are many others, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end. <br /><br />Book 1: <i>Text</i> is largely theoretical, and sets forth the concepts on which the Course's thought system is based. Its ideas contain the foundation for the lessons in Book 2, the <i>Workbook for Students.</i> Without the practical application the <i>Workbook</i> provides, the <i>Text</i> would remain largely a series of abstractions which would hardly suffice to bring about the thought reversal at which the Course aims. <br /><br />Book 2: <i>Workbook for Students</i> includes 365 lessons, one for each day of the year. It is not necessary, however, to do the lessons at that tempo, and one might want to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day. The practical nature of the <i>Workbook</i> is underscored by the introduction to its lessons, which emphasizes experience through application rather than a prior commitment to a spiritual goal. Some of the ideas the <i>Workbook</i> presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true. <br /><br />Book 3: <i>Manual for Teachers</i> is written in question and answer form, and provides answers to some of the more likely questions a student might ask. It also includes a clarification of a number of the terms the Course uses, explaining them within the theoretical framework of the <i>Text</i>. The Course makes no claim to finality, nor are the lessons in its <i>Workbook</i> intended to bring the student's learning to completion. At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher, Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit. <br /> 
<br />Supplements to ACIM, "Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice" and "The Song of Prayer", were scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman, as was <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, and are extensions of its principles.",

    "description": "Most men have no idea that the women they know and love are testing them. These men go about their lives interacting with the opposite sex in absolute darkness, ignorant to the fact that they're being judged, appraised, approved, and rejected based on their subconscious reactions to female testing. <br /><br />If you had no idea that women test men and why they have to, you're about to take a journey onto a road less traveled - the more mysterious side of female psychology and how women think. <br /><br />So if you're dating or in a relationship and women constantly create drama, lose interest in you, or manipulate you, it's time you finally got some advice from one of the only relationship audiobooks for men that won't turn you into a doormat. <br /><br />Here's what you're going to learn: <br /> 
 
 How to be radically honest with a woman and why this makes her more attracted to you.  
 The reason why women test men consistently and how to use this knowledge to deepen a woman's desire.  
 How to make a woman happy without becoming a complete doormat of a man.  
 How to seduce your wife and get her in the mood by responding like a man whenever she "pokes the bear".  
 How to be firm and say no to the woman you love without destroying intimacy.  
 How to keep a woman interested in you by doing the one thing most men are deathly afraid of doing.  
 How to avoid unnecessary arguments, fights, and drama with a woman by using a simple communication technique.  
 The best way to secretly test a woman's level of romantic interest in you before making a long-term commitment.

A fascinating history into Egypt itself which has made me want to find out more. I was unable to put this book down and now I am at a loss to know what to read next."<br /><br />"A great novel should transport you to a time and place. The Hidden took me straight to the heart of Cairo where the heat and the buzz of the streets, with all their sights, sounds and smells, were tangible. This is an epic tale of loss, love, revenge and revolution, where no-one is quite as they seem. The breadth and scope of the novel, together with tight management of a large cast, are two of Chumas's greatest achievements."<br /><br />THE HIDDEN (Book 1, Part 1)<br /><br />Cairo, Egypt, 1919<br /><br />Hezba, the rebellious seventeen-year-old daughter of the Sultan of Egypt, lives a life of luxury in a mansion overlooking the river Nile. Locked away in the harem, she has everything she wants, except the one thing that will keep her from madness; her freedom.<br /><br />The Sultan has ordered Hezba back into the care of her husband, the ageing and abusive Khalil al-Shezira, but Hezba's secret lover has other ideas, so does Hezba. She wants al-Shezira gone from her life and she wants change. She'll stop at nothing to achieve her desires.<br /><br />In 1919, Egypt, and in a world reeling from the devastation of the First World War, Hezba is considered a dangerous female; as the daughter of the Sultan of Egypt, she is expected to do as she is told. But for Hezba, submission is impossible; love, revolution and freedom from repression are worth dying for.<br /><br />Told through her scribblings in her parchment notebook, The Hidden (Book 1, Part 1), was originally published by Thomas &amp; Mercer, USA as The Hidden, a novel that won the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award (ABNA) in 2013, in the Mystery/Suspense category and became an overnight bestseller.<br /><br />Now published by 8d Press, the original novel The Hidden has become a seven-book series.",

This audiobook is best used after the Core 100 words are mastered so as not to intimidate the student. <br /><br />The first audiobook is quick and brief, just focusing on the core knowledge needed for doing well in this area of the test as well as becoming a better reader and writer. Choate learned that the first step in learning a subject should be an easy accessible one. Most Test Prep books strut across the stage with length and depth that is intimidating to anyone from a Ph.D. on down. Imagine the negative impact on a high school student? Less is more in the early steps of learning. Later the students can expand their knowledge if not crushed in the first contact with it. <br /><br />If this simple approach was good enough to help Choate students get into Harvard, it should be good for the rest of us! Enjoy. It's fun to test oneself on these words, no matter your purpose for doing so. This is a perfect listen on the way to school, work, or the test itself!",

This was before there were significant edits in 1975. This edition was discovered in 1999 and was first published by Course in Miracles Society in 2006.<br /><br />Taken from the original manuscript for the Course, the only editing that has been done to this great spiritual classic has been to correct occasional typographic and spelling errors and to render capitalization and punctuation consistent.<br /><br />The volume that you will be listening to here is the <i>Text</i>, which is the first of the three-volume set: <i>Text</i>, <i>Workbook</i>, and <i>Manual for Teachers</i>. These volumes were scribed by Helen Schucman with the help of William Thetford, as she listened to an inner voice that identified Itself as Jesus.&#xa0;<br /><br />The narrator Martin Weber, [maz], is a longtime friend and member of CIMS Europe, a musician, and, of course, a student of <i>A Course in Miracles</i>. Maz sits with the material in meditation before he begins his recording and then adds music that he has composed for a perfect accompaniment.&#xa0;",

She's been charged with supervising twelve-year old aspiring inventor Avon Starros on a cruiser headed to the dedication of a wondrous new space station called Starlight Beacon.<br /><br />But soon into their journey, bombs go off aboard the cruiser. While the adult Jedi try to save the ship, Vernestra, Avon, Avon's droid J-6, a Jedi Padawan, and an ambassador's son make it to an escape shuttle, but communications are out and supplies are low. They decide to land on a nearby moon, which offers shelter but not much more. And unbeknownst to them, danger lurks in the forest?.",

    "description": "Guaranteed to give the student a solid core list of words for the SATs. Unlike most SAT prep courses, this short concise audiobook is laser focused on the words themselves. It does not wear down and intimidate the student with length and breadth. This list was first developed at Choate, the distinguished American preparatory school with a wide range of graduates ranging from Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy to Edward Albee and the actor Michael Douglas. Choate had a long honored tradition of not only getting its graduates into Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, but also having over 75% of them graduate in the top half of those classes. Choate, along with Andover and Exeter, were the only schools that the Harvard Admission Office would predict their students would have a higher grade point than at their high school. <br /><br />It is from this tradition of laser focused learning that this SAT prep audiobook comes. The words were first put forth by a legendary teacher, John Joseph, as the core 100. "Get these right and we can move on; but first get these memorized." As the audiobook says, Choate had the confidence to start simply with a foundation in a subject before moving to greater efforts. This is such an audiobook. <br /><br />The SAT words have remained largely the same over 50 years. A comparison to other texts indicates that about 98% of the words have been the same over this period, as an educated listener would expect. After this basic non-intimidating approach, a student can move on to the SAT and GRE 500 Words. But first start at the beginning. <br /><br />With the Core 100 words students will enjoy the speed at which they master this foundation of the language without having to wade through a long audiobook to get to this core knowledge. The very shortness encourages students to relisten to master this core subject.",

    "description": "<b>A landmark book that reveals the way boys think and that shows parents, educators and coaches how to reach out and help boys overcome their most common and difficult challenges -- by the bestselling author who changed our conception of adolescent girls.</b><br />&#xa0;<br />Do you constantly struggle to pull information from your son, student, or athlete, only to encounter mumbling or evasive assurances such as “It’s nothing” or “I’m good?”&#xa0; Do you sense that the boy you care about is being bullied, but that he’ll do anything to<i> </i>avoid your “help?”&#xa0;&#xa0; Have you repeatedly reminded him that schoolwork and chores come before video games only to spy him reaching for the controller as soon as you leave the room? Have you watched with frustration as your boy flounders with girls?<br />&#xa0;<br />Welcome to Boy World. It’s a place where asking for help or showing emotional pain often feels impossible. Where sports and video games can mean everything, but working hard in school frequently earns ridicule from “the guys” even as they ask to copy assignments. Where “masterminds” dominate and friends ruthlessly insult each other but can never object when someone steps over the line. Where hiding problems from adults is the ironclad rule because their involvement only makes situations worse. Boy world is governed by social hierarchies and a powerful set of unwritten rules that have huge implications for your boy’s relationships, his interactions with you, and the man he’ll become. If you want what’s<i> </i>best for him, you need to know what these rules are and how to work with them effectively.<br />&#xa0;<br />What you’ll find in <i>Masterminds and Wingmen </i>is critically important for every parent – or <i>anyone </i>who cares about boys – to know. Collaborating with a large team of middle- and high-school-age editors, Rosalind Wiseman has created an unprecedented guide to the life your boy is <i>actually</i> experiencing – his on-the-ground reality.&#xa0; Not only does Wiseman challenge you to examine your assumptions, she offers innovative coping strategies aimed at helping your boy develop a positive, authentic, and strong sense of self.",

    "description": "Renowned psychologist Walter Mischel, designer of the famous Marshmallow Test, explains what self-control is and how to master it. <br /><br />A child is presented with a marshmallow and given a choice: Eat this one now, or wait and enjoy two later. What will she do? And what are the implications for her behavior later in life? <br /><br />The world's leading expert on self-control, Walter Mischel has proven that the ability to delay gratification is critical for a successful life, predicting higher SAT scores, better social and cognitive functioning, a healthier lifestyle and a greater sense of self-worth. But is willpower prewired, or can it be taught? <br /><br />In <i>The Marshmallow Test</i>, Mischel explains how self-control can be mastered and applied to challenges in everyday life - from weight control to quitting smoking, overcoming heartbreak, making major decisions, and planning for retirement. With profound implications for the choices we make in parenting, education, public policy and self-care, <i>The Marshmallow Test</i> will change the way you think about who we are and what we can be.",

    "description": "<b>You are five texts away from a date with her....</b><br /><br />Do you know most men make texting girls far harder than it needs to be? And that it can be simple to text a girl you like out on a date? This easy-to-use, step-by-step guide shows you how to text a girl, what to text, and when to text it to her.<br /><br />If you're tired of "spin your wheels" texting advice, buy this audiobook. Its approach draws from 18 cutting-edge scientific studies on texting. And it's authored by the founder of the highest traffic men's dating advice website on the Internet, GirlsChase.com.<br /><br />What you will learn inside:<br />
Who the four kinds of texters are (plus: which one you are)
How to text a girl you like (use the powerful JGIG texting system)
Exactly what to text girls: what topics to text and which to avoid
What are the four big reasons most guys struggle to turn phone numbers into dates (these are so easy to correct)
How to tell if a girl likes you over text. Do this one thing, and you will know, with certainty, if she like you or not
How to "break the ice" with a girl over text in a way that kills awkwardness and gets her to text you
How to get a girl to like you over text (hint: no clueless questions or long-winded text jousts!)
What to do when a girl doesn't text back - apply these two dos and don'ts, and you'll get her texting today, four times out of five
How to flirt with a girl over text and make her excited to meet up with you - you'll learn why "less" is "more" and just how much to actually do
What is an easy way to make sure girls almost never cancel the dates you plan with them over text. To do this, you'll use a simple, powerful trick called the "pre-meeting text"
What to do if a girl flakes on you (the good news: handle this well, and her attraction for you goes through the roof)
How to make a phone call to a girl that "resets" her interest in you (this works like magic at times when nothing else does)
What is the single most effective way to resume texting a girl you haven't talked to in weeks or months
How to start a conversation with a girl over text message; to do this right, you must use one of the two patented "text objectives"
What is an example text conversation, start to finish, that ties everything in the book together (this lets you see how all the pieces work, end to end)
Plus tons of examples, scientific study findings, and rules to texting women most men never unearth on their own, no matter how many texts they send.

<br />As a free bonus, only for book buyers, you'll receive the link to a 93-minute bonus podcast on texting with girls. In this bonus podcast, Chase answers 79 texting questions from readers (like you) on every imaginable texting women question. This podcast is not available to the public or anywhere else. It exists solely as a "thank you" to buyers of this book.<br /><br />If you'd like more dates with more girls, if you'd like the girl you've texted forever to finally see you, if you want to stop wasting time on text conversations that go nowhere and have fun, concise text chats that get girls off their phones and out in person with you...then buy this book.<br /><br /><i>How to Text a Girl</i> won't just change your texting habits. It'll change your entire dating life forever.",
